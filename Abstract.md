# Abstract
In this project, identification of a DC motor, design and implementation of proper controllers for position and velocity control purpose is presented. The setup and modeling can also be used as a haptic tool. Initial practical tests were taken for step, ramp, and sinus inputs, and the responses were recorded. Using MATLAB Identification toolbox, the motor was modeled, and the transformation function was derived. Also, the transformation function was theoretically determined using the motor's mechanical and electrical properties. PID, PD, and lead-lag controllers were designed for both practical and theoretical transformation functions. Experimental and simulation tests were taken for all design controllers using an Arduino Uno board, and results were compared.
